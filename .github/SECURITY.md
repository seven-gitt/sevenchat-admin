# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only [the last published version](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/releases/latest) of the project is supported.
This means that only the latest version will receive security updates.
If you are using an older version, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact us using the [#synapse-admin:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse-admin:etke.cc) Matrix room.
The Synapse Admin project is a static JS UI for the Synapse server,
so it is unlikely that there are (or will be) any impactful security vulnerabilities in the project itself.
However, we do not rule out the possibility of such cases, so we will be happy to receive any reports!
