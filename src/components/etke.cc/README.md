# etke.cc-specific components

This directory contains [etke.cc](https://etke.cc)-specific components, unusable for any other purposes and/or configuration.

We at [etke.cc](https://etke.cc) attempting to develop everything open-source, but some things are too specific to be used by anyone else. This directory contains such components - they are only available for [etke.cc](https://etke.cc) customers.

Due to the specifics mentioned above, these components are documented here rather than in the [docs](../../../docs/README.md), plus they are not supported as part of the Synapse Admin open-source project (i.e.: no issues, no PRs, no support, no requests, etc.).

## Components

### Server Status icon

In the application bar the new monitoring icon is displayed that shows the current server status, and has the following color dot (and tooltip indicators):

* ðŸŸ¢ (green) - the server is up and running, everything is fine, no issues detected
* ðŸŸ¡ (yellow) - the server is up and running, but there is a command in progress (likely [maintenance](https://etke.cc/help/extras/scheduler/#maintenance)), so some temporary issues may occur - that's totally fine
* ðŸ”´ (red) - there is at least 1 issue with one of the server's components
